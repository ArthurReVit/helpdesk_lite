## Swagger

Swagger is a tool that allows you to document and test your API. You can access the swagger [here](http://localhost:5000/apidocs).

## Workflow

For each endpoint added to the swagger, it is important to keep in mind the respective category it belongs to. The categories are:

- [Auth](../api/auth.md)
- [Users](../api/users.md)

Said categories will be extended as we progress with the development of the project.
