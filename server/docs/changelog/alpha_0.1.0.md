# Alpha 0.1.0

## Changes

- Created the initial documentation for the project's structure. You can find the general index [here](../README.md).
- The models for the database have been created and documented. The models' location is under `server/models/` and the documentation can be accesed via - [Models](../models/models.md).
- Added some initial endpoints for the API. Some of them are prototypes for now, but the following are already tested, working and added to the swagger. You can refer to the general docs [here](../api/api.md). Only the tested endpoints are listed:
  - POST /api/auth/login
  - POST /api/users/register
